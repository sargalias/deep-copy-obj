## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- NPM

Installation requires [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is included with [Node](https://nodejs.org/). You can install Node by downloading the installer from the website.

To update NPM to the latest version:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/sargalias/deep-copy-obj.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```
npm install
```

### Running the project for development

```
npm start
```

## Usage

### Starting the project

- Start the project on a local server: `npm start`

### Building the project

- Build the project for production: `npm run build`
- Build the project for development (linting errors won't fail the build): `npm run build:dev`
- Run the build in watch mode: `npm run build:watch`

### Running the tests

- Run Jest tests with coverage: `npm test`
- Run Jest tests without coverage: `npm run test:no-coverage`
- Run Jest tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`

### Code formatting and linting

- Format code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatter: `npm run format`
- Run lint check: `npm run lint`
- Run lint check in fix mode: `npm run lint:fix`
